# Cheat Sheet Generator

A CodingNomads-themed cheat sheet generator that uses `.yml` input files and outputs `.html` and `.txt` files.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/CodingNomads/utils`.
2. Add a new `.yml` file in the `data/` subdirectory. See the existing files to experiment with how to format your content.
3. Run `make` in your CLI to generate the cheat sheets.
4. Convert the `.html` file to `.pdf`.
5. Add the new PDF cheat sheet file to <https://github.com/CodingNomads/cheatsheets>.
6. Get the raw file URL and link the cheat sheet as a downloadable file in your course content.
